	Can be walked on by the player
	Makes the world feel 3D


The "Cast" series (S Corner (CAST System).png, C Corner (CAST System).png, et cetera):
	Is to shore up problems in the uniformity of the core 9 tiles


The "Alternative" series (Alternative (For Bottom Center).png, et cetera):
	Is for flare
	Add whenever you want


The Floor.png:
	Is to be walked upon
	I'm assuming that hallways with be 2 tiles wide or more - you don't have to do that though
